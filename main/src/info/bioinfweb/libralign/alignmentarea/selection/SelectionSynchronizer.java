/**
 * Instances of this class allow to synchronize different instances of {@link SelectionModel} if possible.
 * <p>
 * Note that synchronizing multiple selection models will usually require that the associated sequence data
 * providers of all selection models contain the same number of columns and rows.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> This implementation is not thread save. All registered selection models should only be modified
 * by the same thread. Its recommended to e.g. use {@link EventQueue#invokeLater(Runnable)} in Swing applications or
 * similar methods.
