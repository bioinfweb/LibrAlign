/**
 * This class allows to use multiple instances of {@link AlignmentArea}, that are coupled related to horizontal
 * scrolling. This can e.g. be used to display a data area with heading information (e.g. {@link SequenceIndexArea}) 
 * which always remains visible independently of the vertical scrolling of the alignment it belongs to. (To achieve this
 * you would add to alignment areas to an instance of this class, one containing the heading data area and the other one
 * containing the alignment.)
 * <p>
 * Note that it makes only sense to combine alignment areas that display related information and therefore have an
 * equal number of according columns.
