/**
 * Abstract implementation of an iterator returning the IDs of all sequences provided by an implementation
 * of {@link SequenceDataProvider}.
 * <p>
 * Besides the sequence provider this class needs another iterator as a constructor parameter which is 
 * responsible for returning new IDs in the correct order. This class implements a remove method which 
 * throws an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} if the underlying data source does not allow writing
 * sequences and calls the remove methods of the specified iterator. Additionally it offers an abstract
 * method {@link #doRemove()} that allows the implementations of {@link SequenceDataProvider} to perform 
 * additional specific removal operations. When overwriting this method the ID that is currently removed 
 * can be obtained by {@link #getCurrentID()}.
