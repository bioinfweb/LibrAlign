/**
 * Implements all methods dealing with the organization of the sequence set using some implementation
 * of {@link Map} to identify the sequence object belonging to a sequence ID. The ordering of the
 * sequences is implemented using an additional list storing the IDs. Inherited classes have the option 
 * to provide a custom map implementation instead of {@link TreeMap} which is the default.
 * <p>
 * Sequences are sorted by the order they are added to the model. This ordering in independent to the
 * {@link SequenceOrder} object used in an associated {@link AlignmentArea}.
