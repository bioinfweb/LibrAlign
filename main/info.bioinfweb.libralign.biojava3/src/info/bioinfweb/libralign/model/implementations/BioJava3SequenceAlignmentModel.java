/**
/**
 * An implementation of {@link AlignmentModel} backed by a set of <i>BioJava</i> {@link Sequence} implementations.
 * This class does not allow to write tokens (compounds) since this is not supported by the 
 * {@link Sequence} interface.
 * <p>
 * Although sequences may be added and removed from instances of this class, {@link #addSequence(String)} will
 * add {@code null} as a new sequence. The technical reason is that this class cannot create instance of the 
 * unknown type {@code S}. It would anyway not make much sense to use this method, since the new sequence could 
 * not be edited. If concrete new sequences shall be added, {@link #addSequence(String, Object)} should be used 
 * instead.   
 * 
 * @author Ben St&ouml;ver
 *
 * @param <S> the type of <i>BioJava</i> sequence objects used by the underlying {@link LightweightProfile} 
 * @param <C> the compound type used by the underlying <i>BioJava</i> sequence objects
