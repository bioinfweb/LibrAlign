/**
 * Interface to be implemented by all readers that process <i>JPhyloIO</i> events to read data to be stored in
 * implementations of {@link DataModel}.
 * <p>
 * All implementations should accept an instance of {@link DataModel} as a constructor parameter that
 * will than be returned by {@link #getModels()}. Implementing classes should not allow to change the model
 * during runtime, since changing the model between two calls of 
 * {@link #processEvent(info.bioinfweb.jphyloio.JPhyloIOEventReader, info.bioinfweb.jphyloio.events.JPhyloIOEvent)}
 * should be avoided.
