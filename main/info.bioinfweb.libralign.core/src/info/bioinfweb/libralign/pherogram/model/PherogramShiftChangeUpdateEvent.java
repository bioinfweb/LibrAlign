/**
 * Event object describing a change in the alignment between the editable sequence in a matrix and the associated base call sequence of a pherogram.
 * <p>
 * Note that this event indicates that the a shift stored in {@link PherogramAreaModel was increased or decreased at the specified position by a call 
 * of {@link PherogramAreaModel#addShiftChange(int, int)}. It does not contain any information on absolute shift values, but only on relative changes.
 * <p>
 * The shift change list used internally by {@link PherogramAreaModel} may change in different ways depending on the values of {@link #getBaseCallIndex()} 
 * and {@link #getShiftChange()}, also at multiple positions at a time. These are internal implementation-related operations and such changes of absolute 
 * values are not necessarily indicated by this event. (See {@link PherogramAreaModel#setShiftChange(int, int)} for details.) This event only indicates
 * relative changes triggered by calls of {@link PherogramAreaModel#addShiftChange(int, int)}, which are relevant for the application.
