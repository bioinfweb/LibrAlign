/**
 * Event object used by {@link AlignmentSubArea} that provides information on the area of a component
 * displaying a part of an alignment to be painted, the graphics context and tool methods.
 * <p>
 * The coordinates used in {@link #getRectangle()} and {@link #getGraphics()} are relative to the left
 * most pixel of {@link #getFirstColumn()}. Therefore the x-coordinate 0 does not reference the left most
 * pixel of the whole component but the left most pixel of the area currently to be repainted. Relative
 * coordinates are used to avoid overflows when painting very long sequences.
