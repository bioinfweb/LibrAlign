/**
 * Event object used by {@link AlignmentSubArea} that provides information on the area of a component
 * displaying a part of an alignment to be painted, the graphics context and tool methods.
 * <p>
 * The coordinates used in {@link #getRectangle()} and {@link #getGraphics()} are relative to the left
 * most pixel of {@link #getFirstColumn()}. Therefore the x-coordinate 0 does not reference the left most
 * pixel of the whole component but the left most pixel first alignment column to be repainted. Relative
 * coordinates are used to avoid overflows when painting very long sequences.
 * <p>
 * If the rectangle to be painted contains parts of the area left of the first alignment column, the 
 * return value of {@link #getFirstColumn()} will always be be 0 (even of the first column itself is not 
 * visible). Coordinates of {@link #getRectangle()} will still be relative to the left pixel of the column 
 * 0 and its x-coordinate will therefore be negative. The coordinate system used in {@link #getGraphics()}
 * will be identical so that painting can be performed using respective negative x-coordinates.
