/**
 * Forwards key and mouse events received by an {@link AlignmentContentArea} to the respective 
 * {@link AlignmentSubArea}. For key events that is the first sequence area currently containing 
 * the cursor and for mouse events the are containing the point where the mouse event occurred.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are used when {@link AlignmentSubArea}s paint directly on the toolkit
 * component of {@link AlignmentContentArea} (currently only optionally the case in <i>SWT</i>)
 * to allow the subareas to receive input events, even if they have no associated toolkit 
 * component. (Since no toolkit components for the subareas exists, it is not possible to 
 * determine the subarea owning the focus, which is why the alignment cursor position defines 
 * the receiver subarea for key events.)
 * <p>
 * Events are not forwarded directly but copies are created that reference the respective 
 * {@link AlignmentSubArea} as the source and mouse event coordinates are transformed to the
 * coordinate system origin used by the respective {@link AlignmentSubArea}.
 * <p>
 * This class is used by <i>LibrAlign</i> components internally. There is usually no need to
 * reference it directly in application code.
