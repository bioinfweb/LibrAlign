/**
 * Implementation of a <i>TIC</i> component that displays a single {@link AlignmentSubArea}. It delegates its paint method
 * to {@link AlignmentSubArea#paintPart(AlignmentPaintEvent)}. {@link AlignmentSubArea#createComponent()} returns instances 
 * of this class if inherited classes do not overwrite it.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class will only be used by an {@link AlignmentArea} is set to use subcomponents and will not be able to
 * display sequences that use up more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} pixels. If <i>SWT</i> under <i>Windows</i> is used as 
 * the target toolkit, the maximum component width will currently only be 32768 pixels (due to a limitation in GUI component 
 * libraries of these operating systems). If larger sequences need to be handled, {@link AlignmentArea} should be set not to 
 * use subcomponents.
