/**
 * Allows to conveniently listen to events from all {@link AlignmentArea} instances or their associated {@link AlignmentModel} implementations 
 * contained in one instance of {@link MultipleAlignmentsContainer}.
 * <p> 
 * More precisely, alignment model events from alignment models associated with all {@link AlignmentArea} instances contained within the same 
 * {@link MultipleAlignmentsContainer} and data area list events from all such {@link AlignmentArea} instances will be forwarded to respective
 * listeners registered here using {@link #addAlignmentModelListener(MultipleAlignmentsContainer, AlignmentModelListener)} or 
 * {@link #addDataAreasListener(MultipleAlignmentsContainer, DataAreasListener)}. 
 * <p>
 * Registered listener will receive events from all alignment areas in the container and their associated models  at any time. The forwarding 
 * structure will be adjusted when alignment areas in the container are added, removed or replaced and when alignment models associated with 
 * the alignment areas change.
