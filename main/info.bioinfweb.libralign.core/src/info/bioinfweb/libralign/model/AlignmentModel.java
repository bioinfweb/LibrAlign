/**
 * Interface that allows LibrAlign GUI elements to access different types of alignment data sources.
 * Classes implementing this interface act as a model for the sequence names and tokens (e.g. nucleotide
 * or amino acid compounds).
 * <p>
 * All sequences stored are identified by an string ID and not by their names that are possibly displayed
 * to an application user, because these names might change during runtime. Subclasses must ensure that
 * these IDs are unique and do not change during runtime. Additionally IDs of deleted sequences should not 
 * be reused, because other objects might have stored references to these using its ID and therefore would 
 * not be able to determine that the sequence became deleted, if a new sequence with the same ID is present.
 * <p>
 * The ordering of sequences in an {@link AlignmentContentArea} is not defined by the model implementation 
 * but by the instance returned by {@link AlignmentContentArea#getSequenceOrder()}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface leaves it up to the implementation if the alignment data is organized in objects
 * storing whole sequences (rows) or another storage pattern. If your implementation uses sequence objects
 * consider implementing {@link SequenceAccessAlignmentModel}.
