/**
 * This interface should be implemented by all classes specifying a set of tokens (sequence elements, e.g.
 * nucleotides) that can be aligned in an {@link AlignmentArea} and are provided by an implementation of
 * {@link AlignmentModel}.
 * <p>
 * Implementing classes define a set of valid tokens that may be contained in an alignment and define
 * an optional keyboard shortcut a user of LibrAlign can use to insert the according token into an alignment.
 * <p>
 * Note that implementations may also represent a set of continuous values. In this case the implementation
 * should return {@code true} for {@link #isContinuous()}, {@code null} for {@link #iterator()},
 * {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} for {@link #size()} and {@code false} for {@link #isEmpty()}. The optional add
 * and remove operations may throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}s.
