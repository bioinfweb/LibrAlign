# LibrAlign

*LibrAlign* is an open source *Java* library providing GUI components for displaying and editing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and attached raw- and metadata.

It is distributed under [LGPL](http://bioinfweb.info/LibrAlign/License/LGPL). More information can be found at http://bioinfweb.info/LibrAlign/.

## Key features

* Flexible and powerful GUI components for displaying one or a set of MSAs together
* Data areas can be attached to each sequence or alignment. A set of predefined data areas is included and custom areas can easily be added using the API interfaces.
* All GUI components are based on [TIC](https://github.com/bioinfweb/TIC) and can therefore be used both in *Swing* and *SWT* (including *Eclipse RCP*) applications.
* Reading and writing data and metadata from and to numerous alignment formats using [JPhyloIO](https://github.com/bioinfweb/JPhyloIO)
* Different extensible data model implementations, including compressed sequence storage to handle large datasets
* Interoperability with [BioJava](https://github.com/biojava/biojava)
