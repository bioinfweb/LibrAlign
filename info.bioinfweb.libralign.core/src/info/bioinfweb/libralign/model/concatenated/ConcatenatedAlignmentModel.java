/**
 * This interface allows to concatenate multiple instances of {@link SequenceDataProvider} implementations.
 * It extends {@link SequenceDataProvider} by additional methods allowing to add and remove underlying
 * models which provide the contents a sets of subsequent columns of the concatenated alignment.
 * <p>
 * Each contained model may provide a different token set valid for the part of the alignment it models. 
 * To allow combining any different token sets this interface does not have a generic token type but uses 
 * {@link Object} as the token type instead. Implementing classes should return a global token set 
 * containing all tokens if the different submodels with the according inherited method.
